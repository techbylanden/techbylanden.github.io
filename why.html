        <h2>My Opinion</h2>
        <p>
            I like dogs because they are playful, (most of the time) less agressive, and personally I think that they are cuter. I've never had a cat, but I still think that they are a good pet but I still think dogs are better. Dogs are a better choice for people who have time to be with them and aren't ignoring them a lot because they are playful. Cats like sleeping so they are easier if you are working a lot and don't have a lot of time to spend with them. Personally I like dogs because I like to spend time with them and because I just like them more.
